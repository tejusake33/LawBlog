                  renunciation means and how it will affect you and your family. Though you may be motivated by
                  philosophical differences and tax benefits, you should ensure that renunciation is the best thing for
                  you. Thus, you should think about it and weigh the downsides vs. its benefits, since renunciation is

                  outside your country of residency. Moreover, you have to bring with you your U.S. passport, new

                  renunciation appointment. At the end of your appointment, you will be given DS-4083 as physical proof

            <p class="mt-3 text-xl text-justify prose prose-indigo prose-lg text-gray-500 ">A taxpayer who has delinquent tax debt should consider applying for an IRS tax amnesty program. It is a wise step to clear past taxes and keep the IRS penalties at bay before renouncing U.S. citizenship. The U.S. expats may avail of the <span class="text-red-600"> Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedure</span> if they fail to file taxes on time due to non-willful conduct. 
            <br>
              According to this tax amnesty program, the taxpayer is required to file three (3) years of tax returns, and six (6) years of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). A delinquent U.S expatriate who complies with this process should pay for their past taxes with corresponding interest. However, these individuals are not subject to face any penalties.

              The IRS can (and will) <span class="text-red-600"> revoke or deny your passport for unpaid tax</span>. </p>

          <div class="relative ml-5 text-left mx-0">
            <p class="mt-3 text-xl text-justify prose prose-indigo prose-lg text-gray-500 ">Generally, the estate tax implication can be applied to all property under the name of a U.S. citizen and to a U.S. property owned by a non-U.S. citizen. While renunciation of U.S. citizenship may protect non-U.S. properties and assets from estate tax exposure, it can greatly increase the exposure of U.S. assets owned at death, such as U.S. stocks and real estate. 
             <br>
              Why? It is because a U.S. citizen can protect $11.8 million of properties and assets from the estate tax while a non-U.S. citizen can only shield $60,000 of U.S. properties and assets from such tax implications. The cost of this often unforeseen tax can be significantly high because of the estate tax rate, which has a maximum rate of 40%. </p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-xl text-justify prose prose-indigo prose-lg text-gray-500 ">After you have successfully renounced your U.S. citizenship, you are still eligible for Social Security — only if you are qualified with enough credit. Plus, you can still receive and enjoy 401K and your retirement income. But, these are all subject to US tax. However, military pension benefits are revoked when an ex-pat has left the United States and is being called out of the active military role as a non-citizen. Here, you might be required to file the 1040NR return — except if you have been offered automatic withholdings.

              Furthermore, the expelled individual doesn’t have any reason to do so, except to report international income tax and pay tax obligations. For any changes, you must let the IRS officials know through IRS form 8854, then file the copies with the Department of the treasury. If you fail to file Form 8854, this only means that you are considered subject to an exit tax, which results in being audited. This rule is not only applicable to covered expatriates, but also to those who are green card holders who will need to file such a form within 30 days of you leaving the U.S.</p>

Moreover, the gifts you have given to a U.S person after the renunciation is also taxable and should be paid by the receiver of the gift.

              As such, it is crucial to pay your taxes on time and settle your tax debt before you renounce your citizenship to avoid penalties. Besides that, using the Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedure may also allow you to become tax compliant which is a great factor to leave the U.S. tax system with a clean bank due to renunciation. </p>
