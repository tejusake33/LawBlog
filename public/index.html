                  this process can be complicated and time-consuming. Thus, it is essential to understand what
                  renunciation means and how it will affect you and your family. Though you may be motivated by
                  philosophical differences and tax benefits, you should ensure that renunciation is the best thing for
                  you. Thus, you should think about it and weigh the downsides vs. its benefits, since renunciation is
                  irrevocable. With that in mind, speaking to an experienced U.S. immigration lawyer is crucial before

                  new home country isn’t compulsory, most individuals opt to do so out of convenience. Moreover, it is
                  highly recommended that you acquire legal status in your new home country when you have decided to

                  outside your country of residency. Moreover, you have to bring with you your U.S. passport, new
                  passport, birth certificate, and other identification along with the DS-4079, when attending the
                  renunciation appointment. At the end of your appointment, you will be given DS-4083 as physical proof

However, with the increasing frustration over FATCA and U.S. taxes, it is understandable why a lot of U.S. ex-pats decide to renounce their citizenship despite the long procedure.

But from the date of your expatriation, you’ll become an alien and no longer be required to file taxes as a US citizen. It means that renouncing citizenship will reduce the monetary burden of taxation where you’ll no longer be required to fill out Form 5471 for foreign companies, file a US tax return, or report your bank accounts with the FBAR form. However, even if you renounce, you will still be responsible for U.S. tax if you meet the <span class="text-red-600"> substantial presence test </span>.</p>
